Task Scheduling Problem for Heterogeneous systems is concerned with arranging the various tasks to be
executed on various processors of a system so that computing resources are utilized most effectively. Efficient
task scheduling is very necessary for achieving high performance in heterogeneous environments. The problem
has been shown to be NP-Complete in general cases. Because of its importance, it has been studied extensively
and various algorithms have been proposed till now of which most are designed for homogeneous systems.
There have been few proposals for heterogeneous systems and research is still underway in the field.
In this project we have devised a new algorithm which tries to improve the basic HEFT algorithm, one of the
most efficient algorithms proposed till now, by applying task duplication in it. The comparative study of the
proposed algorithm and the HEFT algorithm at the end shows that it is certainly an improvement for a class of
graphs.
